# JavaScript Function Mastery

## Overview

JavaScript Function Mastery is an educational web platform designed to teach JavaScript functions from beginner to advanced levels. The application provides interactive code execution, comprehensive lessons, and hands-on practice exercises. It's a self-contained learning environment without authentication, progress tracking, or backend user management - focusing purely on content delivery and interactive learning.

The platform covers core JavaScript function concepts including basics, expressions, scope, closures, callbacks, async functions, built-in objects, and algorithmic problem-solving with array rotation. Users can write and execute JavaScript code directly in the browser through an integrated code editor.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React with functional components and hooks, built with Vite as the build tool and development server.

**Routing**: Client-side routing using Wouter (lightweight alternative to React Router) with a multi-page structure including:
- Home page with colorful feature overview, hero section, visual showcase with statistics, and topic cards
- Dedicated lesson pages (Function Basics, Expressions, Scope, Callbacks, Built-in Objects, Array Rotation)
- Practice zone for exercises
- References page for external resources
- Navigation organized with Home → Lessons (dropdown) → Practice → References

**UI Component System**: Built on Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui design system (New York style variant). Uses Tailwind CSS for styling with custom design tokens for educational theming. The design follows Material Design 3 principles adapted for educational content, emphasizing clarity, readability, and progressive disclosure.

**Theme System**: Light/dark mode support via ThemeProvider context, with theme persistence in localStorage. Custom CSS variables define color palettes optimized for both modes with distinct primary (deep blue), secondary (forest green), and semantic colors.

**Interactive Code Editor**: CodeMirror integration with JavaScript syntax highlighting and the One Dark theme. Features live code execution using browser's `eval()` with console output capture, error handling, and vibrant visual feedback with colorful success (green) and error (red) states. Enhanced with colorful borders and hover effects.

**State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management (though currently minimal backend interaction). Local state managed via React hooks (useState, useContext).

**Component Design Patterns**:
- Reusable educational components with vibrant colors (ConceptCard, InfoBox, TryItBox, CodeEditor)
- Color-coded educational elements: Info boxes (cyan), Tips (green), Warnings (orange), Code editors (blue borders)
- Breadcrumb navigation for lesson context
- Responsive navigation with mobile menu and dropdown support
- Consistent card-based layouts with colorful icons, hover shadows, and animations
- Each feature and topic uses distinct colors for visual differentiation

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript running on Node.js.

**Development Environment**: Vite middleware integration for HMR (Hot Module Replacement) in development. Production builds serve static files from the compiled React application.

**Minimal API Surface**: Currently implements a basic route registration pattern but no active API endpoints. The storage interface is defined but unused, suggesting future extensibility for user data or progress tracking.

**Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer (IStorage) with in-memory implementation (MemStorage) for potential user management. Includes methods for user CRUD operations but not currently utilized in the application flow.

### Data Storage Solutions

**Database Schema**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL (Neon serverless) with a users table defined, though authentication is explicitly not implemented per design requirements.

**Schema Definition**: Single users table with id (UUID), username, and password fields. Includes Zod schema validation for type safety.

**Current State**: Database infrastructure is prepared but not actively used. The application operates as a fully static educational site without persistent user data.

### Design System and Theming

**Typography**: Inter font family for UI text, JetBrains Mono for code blocks.

**Color Strategy**: Vibrant, lively color scheme with no gradients, featuring:
- **Primary**: Bright blue (HSL 236 100% 55% light / 236 90% 70% dark) - used for main interactive elements
- **Secondary**: Mint/teal (HSL 160 70% 88% light / 160 60% 28% dark) - used for secondary elements
- **Muted**: Purple tones (HSL 280 45% 92% light / 280 35% 25% dark) - used for backgrounds
- **Accent**: Yellow (HSL 45 100% 88% light / 45 95% 32% dark) - used for highlights
- **Success**: Green (HSL 142 76% 42% light / 142 65% 55% dark) - for success states and tips
- **Warning**: Orange (HSL 32 95% 55% light / 32 90% 65% dark) - for warnings and cautions
- **Info**: Cyan (HSL 200 90% 50% light / 200 85% 60% dark) - for informational content
- Consistent code block backgrounds across themes
- No gradients - solid colors with overlays for depth

**Component Styling**: Custom Tailwind configuration with:
- Extended border radius tokens (sm: 3px, md: 6px, lg: 9px)
- Shadow system for depth (shadow-xs, shadow-sm, etc.)
- Elevation utilities (hover-elevate, active-elevate-2) for interactive feedback without layout shifts
- CSS custom properties for dynamic theme values
- Colorful borders and backgrounds on educational components (CodeEditor, InfoBox, ConceptCard, TryItBox)

**Animation Patterns**: 
- Fade-in animations for page content and components
- Icon rotation effects on hover (no scaling to maintain layout stability)
- Color transitions for hover states
- Shadow depth changes for interactive feedback
- Smooth transitions throughout without element resizing
