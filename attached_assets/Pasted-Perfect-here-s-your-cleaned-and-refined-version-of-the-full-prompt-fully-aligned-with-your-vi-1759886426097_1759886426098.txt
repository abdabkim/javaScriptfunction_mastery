Learners should be able to:

* Read **clear, human-style explanations**
* See **practical, relevant code examples**
* Experiment in a **fully functional code editor**
* Understand every function principle through visuals, analogies, and creative formatting

### üé® Design and Layout

* Use a **clean, modern, and professional UI** with calm colors, clear typography, and good spacing.

* Create a **multi-page site** with the following structure:

  * **Home** (introduction + overview of what users will learn)
  * **Function Basics**
  * **Function Expressions & Arrow Functions**
  * **Function Scope & Closures**
  * **Callbacks, Recursion & Async Functions**
  * **Built-in Object Methods in Functions**
  * **Function Practice Zone**
  * **Glossary & References**

* Add a **top navigation bar** that remains visible across all pages with a highlight for the active section.

* Include **smooth transitions** between pages and **animated hover effects** for menus and code boxes.

* Each section should include:

  * An **intro paragraph**
  * A **visual or example-based concept explanation**
  * **Interactive code blocks** (editable and runnable)
  * A **‚ÄúTry It‚Äù section** with real exercises

### üìö Lesson Content Requirements

All content must be:

* 100% **original (no plagiarism)**
* **Organically written** ‚Äî sound like a real, knowledgeable instructor explaining with enthusiasm
* **Deep yet simple** ‚Äî understandable for beginners but valuable to advanced learners
* **Comprehensive** ‚Äî covering every detail of functions, their behavior, and related built-in methods

Each lesson should:

1. Explain the concept in plain English
2. Provide several code examples (progressively complex)
3. Demonstrate practical use cases
4. Offer a live editor example that runs correctly
5. Show output and step-by-step reasoning
